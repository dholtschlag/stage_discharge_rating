   abstract = {The principles behind the interface to continuous domain spatial models in the RINLA software package for R are described. The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach proposed by Rue, Martino, and Chopin (2009) is a computationally effective alternative to MCMC for Bayesian inference. INLA is designed for latent Gaussian models, a very wide and flexible class of models ranging from (generalized) linear mixed to spatial and spatio-temporal models. Combined with the stochastic partial differential equation approach (SPDE, Lindgren, Rue, and Lindström 2011), one can accommodate all kinds of geographically referenced data, including areal and geostatistical ones, as well as spatial point process data. The implementation interface covers stationary spatial models, non-stationary spatial models, and also spatio-temporal models, and is applicable in epidemiology, ecology, environmental risk assessment, as well as general geostatistics.},

We used quarterly data on supermarket and convenience store locations from Nielsen {TDLinx} (Nielsen Holdings N.V., New York, New York) spanning 7 years (2006–2012) and census tract-based neighborhood sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey (2006–2010) to assess associations between neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics and food store distributions in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas ({MSAs}) of 4 {US} cities (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and San Francisco, California). We fitted a space-time Poisson regression model that accounted for the complex spatial-temporal correlation structure of store locations by introducing space-time random effects in an intrinsic conditionally autoregressive model within a Bayesian framework. After accounting for census tract–level area, population, their interaction, and spatial and temporal variability, census tract poverty was significantly and positively associated with increasing expected numbers of supermarkets among tracts in all 4 {MSAs}. A similar positive association was observed for convenience stores in Birmingham, Minneapolis, and San Francisco; in Chicago, a positive association was observed only for predominantly white and predominantly black tracts. Our findings suggest a positive association between greater numbers of food stores and higher neighborhood poverty, with implications for policy approaches related to food store access by neighborhood poverty.},

  abstract = {Plotting positions are needed for situations where, in addition to a systematically recorded annual flood series, one would have a record of any large floods which occurred during an extended historical period, if they occurred. Many of the published estimators are based on uncensored sampling theory which is not appropriate for such data sets. Here such historical and systematic flood records are viewed as resulting from a partially censored sampling experiment. Plotting positions are derived for such experiments using both classical and Bayesian viewpoints. In general, it is impossible to construct highly accurate estimates of the exceedance probabilities of the largest floods using only their rank, the number of observed historical floods, and the lengths of the historical period and the systematic record. For the largest flood, the coefficient of variation of exceedance‐probability estimators is of the order of 1, as it is for complete systematic records. Examples illustrate the bias and precision of a variety of plotting position formulas. The differences among the different plotting positions are generally small in comparison to the sampling variability. However, plotting positions which are unbiased with uncensored samples are often the most biased when used with a combination of historical and systematic data. Three appendices consider the effect of misspecification of the length of the historical period, the effect of misspecification of the threshold of perception or observation level, and plotting positions for situations with several perception thresholds.}

  abstract = {Historical and paleoflood information can substantially improve flood frequency estimates if appropriate statistical procedures are properly applied. However, the Federal guidelines for flood frequency analysis, set forth in Bulletin 17B, rely on an inefficient “weighting” procedure that fails to take advantage of historical and paleoflood information. This has led researchers to propose several more efficient alternatives including the Expected Moments Algorithm (EMA), which is attractive because it retains Bulletin 17B's statistical structure (method of moments with the Log Pearson Type 3 distribution) and thus can be easily integrated into flood analyses employing the rest of the Bulletin 17B approach. The practical utility of EMA, however, has been limited because no closed‐form method has been available for quantifying the uncertainty of EMA‐based flood quantile estimates. This paper addresses that concern by providing analytical expressions for the asymptotic variance of EMA flood‐quantile estimators and confidence intervals for flood quantile estimates. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the properties of such confidence intervals for sites where a 25‐ to 100‐year streamgage record is augmented by 50 to 150 years of historical information. The experiments show that the confidence intervals, though not exact, should be acceptable for most purposes.}
