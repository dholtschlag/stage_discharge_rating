## Abstract

An adaptive stage-discharge estimation approach is developed to track persistent changes in the relation between water-surface elevations (stages) and streamflow discharges (flows). The approach updates parameters of a cubic spline regression function describing the stage-flow relation using data from periodic discrete flow measurements. The spline parameters form the state vector of a state-space model, while the measurement vector contains the discrete flow measurements. The state-space model is solved iteratively using a Kalman filter. The approach is illustrated using daily data from U.S. Geological Survey streamgage 04122500 Pere Marquette River at Scottville, Mich. Results show the adaptation of a stage-flow relation consistent with rating 18 (applied at the streamgage from 1986-1994), to a relation consistent with rating 21 (applied at the streamgage from 2013-2019), based on 188 discrete flow measurements during the intervening period. In addition, the Kalman filter is used to compute the magnitudes and uncertainties of daily flows at the streamgage for selected years. Once the state-space model estimated from daily values, however, the model can be applied at regular unit (less than daily time intervals) time steps by a simple adjustment of the process variance in the state equation. Persistent or long-term changes in the stage-flow relation can be tracked with this univariate model.  Extension of this model to track intermittent changes, associated with variable ice-backwater for example, would require a multivariate approach involving a streamflow network that is beyond the scope of this model. 

## Background

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) computes records of streamflow at about 8,500 active streamgages throughout the United States. Streamgages measure flow from the upstream basin, which is generally topographically defined.  Computations are commonly based on continual measurements of stage at 10- to 60-minute intervals. The stage data is used to compute corresponding values of flow based on a empirical relation between stage and flow commonly referred to as a rating curve or table. The rating describes a monotonically increasing relation between stage and flow. This rating is developed and maintained on the basis of discrete, contemporaneous measurements of stage and flow that span the typical range of flow conditions at the streamgage. 

The stage-flow relation can change gradually over time due to persistent changes in the channel or overbank hydraulic characteristics, or change abruptly owing to intermittent effects, such as increased backwater associated with aquatic plant growth or ice formation. Once the cause of the intermittent changes are no longer a factor, the stage-flow relation may revert to nominal conditions, consistent with possible persistent changes at the stream site.  

The distinction between persistent and intermittent changes is somewhat arbitrary, but practically determined by the measurement frequency. Abrupt intermittent changes, such as ice backwater effects, can occur on a time scale of days to weeks during periods when no discrete flow measurements occur. The frequency of discrete flow measurements is constrained by the cost of field visits. 

### Scope

This paper describes the preliminary development and testing of an automated approach for estimating a stage-flow relation for a streamgage that sequentially adapts to persistent changes in rating conditions based on discrete flow measurement data. A persistent change is considered to be a slow change in rating conditions relative to the frequency of discrete measurements available to characterize the change. Adaptive tracking can be applied in real-time, considering only past discrete measurements, or offline, considering discrete flow information before and after the time of estimation. Only offline tracking is presented in the paper.  Implementation of the technique requires continual stage data and discrete flow data for implementation. In contrast to persistent changes, intermittent changes represent sudden changes in rating conditions that may be associated with transient effects like those due to ice-affected streamflow.  Intermittent changes may benefit from analysis of multiple streamgages in a network, but is beyond the scope of this study.

### Study Area

USGS streamgage 04122500 Pere Marquette River at Scottville, Mich. was selected for this study. (fig. 1). The Pere Marquette River drains a basin in the west central lower peninsula of Michigan.  The basin has a drainage area of 681 mi^2^ at the streamgage. The basin is heavily forested and includes parts of the Huron-Manistee National Forest. Streamflow has been computed continuously at the site starting in August 1939 and was active at the time of this paper (October 2020). The streamflow rating is commonly ice-affected during the winter months.

## Data Components

Continual streamflow data are commonly computed on the basis of continual stage data, and an empirical relation between stage and flow. The continual intervals are generally less than an hour in length, and are referred to as unit data.  The relation between stage and flow is based on periodic discrete stage and flow measurements obtained during a field visit to the streamgage. A set of discrete measurements is used to manually define a curvilinear relation between stage and flow over an extended stage range. The stage-flow relation is commonly referred to as a rating curve or table. Discrete measurements continue thoughout the period of streamgage operation to confirm, update, extend, and revise the stage-flow relatiion as needed accurately compute streamflow. 

Several data components are critical in computing unit streamflow, and derivative products, such as daily (mean) streamflow. Daily streamflow is the primary streamflow statistic used in many water-resource applications. Daily streamflow is commonly used, for example, to compute flow-duration and high- and low-freqency characteristics widely used in design and decision making. Therefore, daily streamflow was the first streamflow statistic to be accessible electronically. 

Historically, unit stage and flow  values have been considered ancillary data of secondary importance to daily streamflow. High cost of electronic store of these data were prohibitive. More recently, however, both unit stage and flow data has been stored in accessible formats along with information on discrete flow measurements. Ready access to these data have been a limiting factor in developing the analysis presented in this paper. 


### Daily Streamflow

Daily mean streamflow data for the Pere Marquette River were obtained for the period of record using the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) by use of the R package 'dataRetrieval' [@DeCicco2019]. Some of the earlier ancillary data used in computing daily mean flows, however, is only available from archived paper records. In particular, unit stage data and discrete flow measurement data are generally available for Pere Marquette River in electronic format since `r format(date_beg_model, '%b %d, %Y')`. The most recent data used in the analysis was `r format(date_beg_model, '%b %d, %Y')`. In this paper, the period of electronic data availability is referred to as the period of analysis (POA). Data summaries presented in the following sections are restricted to this period.



```{r pub_daily_flow}
# Load daily flows to estimate missing daily mean stage 
if( file.exists('flow_daily_pub.RData')){
  # print('Loading published daily_means from RData file.')
  load('flow_daily_pub.RData')
} else {
  # print('Retrieving daily flow from NWIS')
  flow_daily_pub <- readNWISdv( site_no, parameterCd = '00060', startDate = date_beg_model,
                             endDate = date_end_model)
  # Standardize names
  flow_daily_pub <- renameNWISColumns( flow_daily_pub )
  save(flow_daily_pub, file = 'flow_daily_pub.RData')
}

flow_hpdi <- HPDI( flow_daily_pub$Flow, prob = 0.95 )

```

> Probability Distribution of Daily Flows


The empirical probability distribution describes the relative likelihood of daily flow magnitudes.  Daily flows at Pere Marquette River during the period of analysis varied from `r flow_hpdi[[1]]` and `r flow_hpdi[[2]]` ft^3^/s, 95-percent of the time.  The minimum and maximum daily flows during this period were `r min(flow_daily_pub$Flow)` and `r max(flow_daily_pub$Flow)`, respectively. The mean flow was 787 ft^3^/s. The probability distribution of the flows are asmmetric (right skewed). The natural logarithm of flows, however, is consistent with a three parameter gamma distribution (fig. 2). This distribution is an important consideration in specifying a model to track changes in stage-flow relations.

> Hydraulic Controls and Accuracy Qualifiers

Discrete flow measurement data for Pere Marquette River occurring during the period of analysis were retrieved from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) using the R package dataRetrieval [@DeCicco2019]. Table `r tab_no + 1` summarizes the type of hydraulic control and the accuracy of discrete flow measurements provided by the qualifier. The most common hydraulic control conditions were a 'Clear Channel', and the most common measurement accuracy qualifier was 'Good.'  


The qualifiers assigned to discrete flow measurements by hydrographers in the field were used to estimate uncertainties of the measured flows.  In this paper, a qualifier of 'Excellent' was associated with a standard error of 2 percent; 'Good,' with a standard error of 5 percent; 'Fair,' with a standard error of 8 percent; and 'Poor,' with a standard error of 12-percent. The associations are loosely based on the 'Discharge Measurement Quality Code' descriptions by USGS NWIS at https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters/discharge-measurement-quality-code, accessed Jan. 18, 2020.

> Time Between Discrete Flow Measurements  

The frequency of discrete flow measurements is an important factor in detecting persistent changes in the stage-flow rating and in determining the costs of field operations. During the period of analysis at Pere Marquette River, the mean time between discrete measurements was `r format(mean(df$days_between_measurements), digits = 1)`.

### Unit and Daily Stage

Until recently, unit and daily stage data were considered ancillary variables to the computation of unit and daily flows. Thus, the availability of historical unit and daily stage data is more limited than daily flow data. In particular, limitations in the availability of historical stage data constrained the start of the period of analysis utilized in this paper.  In addition, the number of unit values recorded per day varied during the period of analysis (fig. `r fig_no + 1`). From about October 1, 1989 to May 4, 1994, 24 values per day was common; from May 5, 1994 to February 21, 1997, 288 values per day (5-minute interval data) were common; and after February 21, 1997, 96 values per day (15-minute interval data) were common. Other small irregularities in unit values occurred during the period of analysis. In developing the approach, it would be helpful if a simple method were available to adapt to changing frequencies of unit value data.

> Estimate missing stage based on daily mean flow and rating curve 18

The time series of computed daily mean stage values (fig. `r fig_no + 1`) shows a seasonal variation within which annual minimums appear to have a downward trend. In particular, during the early 1990s, minimum annual stage values were generally greater than 1.6 ft above gage datum, while during the 2010s, minimum annual stage values were generaly 0.6 ft lower. The datum of the gage is 597.66 ft above National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29). 

Most of the missing daily mean stage values occurred during the period Rating 18 was in effect (fig. `r fig_no + 1`). Thus, daily mean flows were used with Rating 18 flow-stage relation to estimate all missing daily mean stage values.

> Stage values used in modeling

Figure `r fig_no + 1 ` shows the close correpondence  between discrete stage on days of field measurements and daily mean stage computed from unit values.  Only one estimated stage occurred on a day of a discrete measurement. For the purpose of modeling flows and tracking the changes in the stage-flow relation, daily mean stages were replace with measured discrete stages on days of field measurement so that even the small discrepency between discrete stage measurements and daily mean stage did not degrade modeling accuracy.

### Historical Stage-Flow Ratings 

Historical Stage-Flow Ratings were retrieved from USGS NWIS data bases using Aquarius Time-Series Software [@Aquarius2017]. The expanded form of the ratings 18-21 were exported in column format.

## Methods for Adapting Stage-Flow Rating to Sequential Discrete Flow Measurements


### Cubic Spline-Regression Model

A Bayesian approach is developed to estimate parameters of a generalized additive model (GAM) [@Wood2006] to describe the dynamic relation between stage and discharge (flow) at a streamgage.  The GAM model provides a basis function and parameter estimates to describe the smooth, monotonically increasing relation between stage and flow using data on direct measurements of stage and flow commonly used to develop a so called rating curve. Bayesian estimation then uses the GAM basis function and re-estimates parameters to explicitly account for the uncertainty in the stage measurements. Data for USGS streamgage 04112500 Red Cedar River at East Lansing, MI are used to illustrate the approach and results of the generally applicable method.  Computations are implemented in the R programming environment [@cite_R].

Spline regression 

Cubic spline regression models all had 5 knots.  Knots are

> Basis Functions 

The basis functions developed using the GAM of the rating tables are plotted in figure `r fig_no + 1` along with the knot locations for each model and basis, excluding the (constant) intercept term.  The co-location of knots with peak magnitudes of the basis functions may result in parameter values associated with the knots being perturbed more when discrete measured stage-flow pairs are near a corresponding knot.

```
The R package MARSS [@MARSS2018] was used in developing the state-space model. The notation below follows the authors' notation. 

### State-Space Model

The state-space model [@MARSS2018]

$$
\begin{align}
    \text{State Equation:  }  x_{t} &= {I_n} \: x_{t-1} + w_t && \text{where } w_t \text{~} MVN(0, Q) \text{,}\\
    \text{Measurement Equation:  } y_{t} &= Z_t \text{ } x_{t} + v_t && \text{where } v_t \text{~} N(0, R_{t = t'}) \text{,}\\
    \text{}
\end{align}
$$

Following notation by [@MARSS2018], $y_t$ is the scalar measurement time series, which has a length equal to the number of days in the period of analysis. $y_t$ contains the natural logarithms of discrete flows on days of field measurements. Otherwise, the elements in the vector contain an *NA* value, indicating that a discrete flow measurement was *not available* on that day. In this analysis, $y_t$ contained `r per_NA` percent *not available* indicators. 

$\vec{x}_t$ is the time series of state vectors, where each vector has a length of 5, corresponding to the number of knots and subsequent parameters specified in the generalized additive model (GAM) cubic spline regression equatiion. Several variations of $\vec{x}_t$ are generated by function *MARSSkf* as Kalman filter and smoother output.  These include *xtT*, which is the smoothed or offline estimate of the state vector at time *t* given all the time steps in the series *T*; *xtt* is the filter estimate of the state vector at time *t* given information up to time *t*; and *xtt1* is the predicted state at time *t* given information up to time *t-1*. 

Q is a $5\times5$ diagonal process variance matrix, which increments the variance *V* of the state vector with each time step in the model.  In the state equation, the process variance indicates the incremental increase in variance of spline regression parameters associated with each day since a discrete measurement of flow occurred. The elements of Q are estimated in the Multivariate Autoregressive State Space (MARSS) model .  To simulate unit flows, the diagonal elements of the Q matrix would be divided by the number of unit values in a day.     

R  is an estimated constant measurement variance

Zt is the design matrix of   

Yt is sequential daily values of log_stage_round 


Note: A multiplicative form for the Q matrix can be specified as:
This is provided just as a reminder of the format for defining Q with a multiplicative constant.
Q <- matrix(list('qb', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '10*qb'), 3, 3)

## Results of State Space Modeling

Results of two model parameterizations are compared.  The first model estimated the process variance matrix Q as a time invariant 5 x 5 diagonal matrix with equal diagonal components and a time-varying scalar measurement variance R. The elements of R were based on the subject quality of the measurement as generally 'Good' with less then 5 percent error, and 'Fair' with an error of
